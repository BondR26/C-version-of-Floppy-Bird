This is a small version of a famous game floppy bird. Only i decide to write a sort of prototype using mostly C
and some elements of C++. It works pretty good. Once every period of time an obstacle goes by and the aim is to try to get over it.
It doesnt have any cool graphics to it, but that was the whole purpose - to try to write something from the total scratch.
